# Connectivity & Communication Protocols Introduction

Connectivity, it is one of the main things to keep in mind while developing any Internet-of-Things (IoT) project.

The first few questions that pop up in our head when We embark on any new IoT project are:

	1. How do we want it to be connected?
	2. Do we have any power or range constraints?
	3. What would be our data rate?
	4. What network infrastructures are currently available?

We are sure a lot of people would have the same questions when starting any IoT project. Sometimes we have an idea about what communication protocol we want to use, but it doesnâ€™t hurt to do our research and make sure that would be the most suitable for our application.

Fortunately, there are a bunch of network infrastructures and communication protocols available. Unfortunately, there are so many that they might render we confused.

In this document, we will discuss all (well, most) of the popular communication protocols and how to pick the most suitable one for our project. We will also go into detail about the pros and cons of each:

	1. WiFi
	2. Bluetooth
	3. RFID and NFC
	4. ZigBee
	5. LoRa
	6. GPRS/EDGE/3G/4G
	7. HTTP/WebSocket
	8. MQTT
	9. CoAP
	10.AMQP
