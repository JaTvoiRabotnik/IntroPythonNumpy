EMBEDDED FUNDAMENTAL

A, Introduce basic terms of embedded hardwares 


I, Embedded Hardware 

a, Microcontroller & Embedded Computer: 

	- What is (and isn't) a microcontroller? 
	- Difference between a microcontroller and a microprocessor (MCU vs MPU)? 
	- Difference between a microcontroller (MCU) and a system-on-a-chip (MCU vs SOC)? 
	- Why use an MCU for IoT?
	- Which MCU is right for you? 
	- Looking beyond the MCU.

b, Embedded Computer 

	- What is Embedded Computer? 
	- Embedded Computer vs Industrial PC vs IoT Gateway?
	- What is an Appliance PC? 
	- Embedded Computers Used for? 
	- What’s the Difference Between an Embedded PC and a Tower Computer? 
	- What’s the Best Embedded Computer? 
II, GPIO, Analog, Digital 

a,GPIO(General-purpose input/output) 

	- What is GPIO(General-purpose input/output)
	- Use GPIO for?

	- 7. Tessel 
	- 6. Adafruit Flora 
	- 5. LightBlue Bean 
	- 4. Udoo Neo 
	- 3. Intel Edison 
	- 2. Raspberry Pi 
	- 1. Arduino Uno 
	
B,Arduino Introduction and Exercise: 

	- Install Arduino IDE
	- Setup Environment for Espressif device 
	- Basic Examples: 	Analog Read Serial 
						Blink 
						Digital Read Serial 
	
	- Digital Examples: Blink Without Delay 
						Use button to control the LED 
						State Change Detection (Edge Detection) for pushbuttons 
	
	- Analog examples:	Control Led with Potentiometer, show result in Serial  
						Analog Write with 12 LEDs on an Arduino Mega 
						Calibration 
	
	- Popular sensors and actuators and display examples:
						Use DHT-22 Sensor to check humidity and temperature. 
						Using an LDR Sensor.
						Proximity Sensors. 
						Display with LCD 1602 via I2C connection
